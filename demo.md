# Welcome to Markovia

A **simple** and *elegant* Markdown editor for VS Code.

## What Makes It Special?

Markovia uses a WYSIWYG approach inspired by **iA Writer**, where:

- The Markdown syntax remains **visible**
- But it *blends into the background*
- Creating a ~~distracting~~ distraction-free writing experience

### Key Features

1. **Bold text** actually appears bold
2. *Italic text* actually appears italic
3. `Inline code` has a subtle background
4. [Links look clickable](https://example.com) with deemphasized URLs
5. <u>Underline</u>

#### Code Blocks

Here's some code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, Markovia!");
}
```

##### Lists and Quotes

> This is a blockquote.
> It appears italicized with faded markers.

- Bullet lists
- Have faded markers
- For a cleaner look

1. Numbered lists
2. Work the same way
3. Clean and simple

- [] Something to do 

###### Try It Out

Open this file in VS Code with Markovia installed and see the magic happen! Press `Ctrl+B` (or `Cmd+B` on Mac) to make text **bold**.

Happy writing!
